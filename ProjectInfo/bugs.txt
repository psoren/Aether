1. TODO: Fix "WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state" error.
There are two stackoverflow articles in the bottom left on this issue.
Read them and fix the issue

2. TODO: When you add a song to the queue, playback starts over at the beginning of the queue

I think what we need to do is check at the end of every song, remove the song that just finished,
and add any new songs that are pending to be added.)
